* notes
- ERC20
  - memorize all erc20 functions (before the 1:1)
  - code it from scratch
  - problems with the spec
   - returning booleans
   - sending it address 0x0 (spec is not saying anything about it being a special address, which many protocols do, e.g. by burning as sending to that address)
   - transferFrom where the recipient is the msg.sender (you).
   - approvals for uint256.max (infinite allowance). Some implementation still deduce it from the allowance.
 - events and what is indexed (addresses)
